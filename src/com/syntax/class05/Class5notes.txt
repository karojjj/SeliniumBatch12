Selenium Class 5

Handling checkboxes and radiobutton:
-- if you have only 1 checkbox or radiobutton - you can just click on it
-- if you have multiple choices - store them in List and loop through

DropDowns
Dropdown is a menu which gives us an opportunity to select one or more options

Types of dropdowns
1. Single select
2. Multiple select

Handling dropdowns:
1. click on dropdown and click on the option
2. using Select class
                in order to use Select class
                we need to make sure our dropdown has
                select tag

Selecting an option from a dropdown can be done in 3 ways:
1. by index
2. by visible text
3. by value

Whenever you interact with multiple elements you store them
inside the container such as List, Set...

In order to deselect any option in dropdown:
-- Make sure your DD is multiple select
deselectByValue()
deselectByVisibleText()
deselectByIndex()
deselectAll()
